Brainstorming

When I think of a Project Owner, I think of someone who is responsible for giving the core concepts of how a project must function once it is complete. The goals that are set by a Project Owner are what should be attempted to achieve over the duration of the project. Although they may not directly work with the team on a day to day basis, I think that this role is influential in the fact that the rest of the team will look up to the Project Owner to make big decisions and solve important problems in the project. 

In terms of a Project Manager, I think of someone who is able to work with the team on a day to day basis providing more hands-on assistance in understanding key goals and requirements set by the Project Owner. In order to help the team achieve the goals of a Product Owner, the Project Manager must make it as simple as possible for the team to follow a plan set up by the Project Manager. This plan can be in the form of creating milestones, reporting progress and frequent team meetings. 

Research

All projects need to have someone that manages it so that it can run efficiently. The managers are the ones that are able to follow the vision set by the company. In most companies, the PM role often refers to those with the Project Manager and Project Owner title. These roles are often held by those who have lots of experience at the company and have goals that align with its companies. 

The difference between the two roles is that the Project Manager is someone who is constantly involved with the product team while the Project Owner is someone who has responsibilities related towards the greater picture of the project. In a more general sense, the project owner is more worried about what the project will be accomplishing and why it will help the company. The project manager on the other hand is more focused on how those goals can be accomplished and who will be accomplishing them on the team. 

In terms of responsibilities, the project owner is someone who has an ownership of the project and is responsible for its success. The project managers will ensure that the goals set by the project owner are easy for the team to be able to understand so that the process can be as simple as possible.
