## The Daily Stand Up

- Scrum Framework:
  - Designed for managing complex projects and emphasizing adaptability
  - Utilizes time-boxed events to provide structure and minimize unnecessary meetings
  - Comprises various events within a Sprint
  - Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation

- Sprint:
  - Fixed time frame, usually a month or less, for creating a usable product increment
  - Contains Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, development work, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective

- Sprint Planning:
  - Collaborative event involving the entire Scrum Team
  - Determines what can be delivered and how to achieve it in the upcoming Sprint
  - Establishes the Sprint Goal and creates the Sprint Backlog

- Daily Scrum:
  - 15 min daily meeting for the Development Team
  - Inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal, plans for the day, and identifies impediments
  - Helps in communication, quick decision-making, and team knowledge enhancement
  - Example: What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

- Sprint Review:
  - Held at the end of the Sprint to review the Increment and adapt the product backlog
  - Opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback and determine the next steps
  - For a 1 month sprint, this should last around 4 hours

- Sprint Retrospective:
  - Occurs after the Sprint Review, allowing the Scrum Team to reflect on processes and teamwork
  - Aims to identify what went well, what could be improved, and create a plan for implementation

- Sprint Cancellation:
  - Can occur if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete or if circumstances change significantly
  - Reviewed completed work and re-estimated incomplete items, consuming resources and impacting the team

- Sprint Goal:
  - Objective set for the Sprint, guiding the Development Team in building the increment
  - Allows for flexibility in functionality implemented during the sprint

- Adaptation and Transparency:
  - Emphasizes regular inspection and adaptation to improve the chances of achieving the Sprint Goal
  - Key focus on transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement

## Chapter 13 Show Progress

- Challenges in Assessing Progress:
  - Good-hearted managers avoid nagging their teams for status updates, but this can hinder their understanding of project progress
  - Merely tracking to-do lists doesn't adequately represent the actual status of the work
  - A team will define a scope before even populating tasks within the project

- Issues with To-Do Lists:
  - To-do lists might not contain tasks that are yet to be discovered or defined, leading to an inaccurate perception of completeness
  - Tasks and scopes in real-life projects evolve as the team delves deeper into the problem, causing lists to grow as progress is made

- Estimates and Uncertainty:
  - Assigning time estimates to tasks might be misleading as the meaning of an estimate varies based on the nature of the work
  - Instead of focusing on what's done or not done, the book suggests shifting focus to what's unknown and what's solved

- The Hill Metaphor:
  - The work on a project can be visualized as a hill where there's an uphill phase (full of uncertainty and problem-solving) and a downhill phase (marked by certainty and execution)
  - The hill metaphor helps in understanding the evolving stages of a project, from uncertainty to clarity and completion.

- Applying the Hill to Scopes:
  - Combining scopes with the hill concept, teams can plot each scope's status on the hill to understand where they stand
  - A tool in Basecamp allows teams to create and update hill charts easily

- Understanding Stuck Points and Refactoring Scopes:
  - The hill chart helps identify where work might be stuck without team members explicitly stating it
  - It prompts conversations to address stuck points, focusing on the work rather than blaming individuals
  - Sometimes, scopes might be stuck due to unclear or too broad definitions, which can be resolved by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts

- Sequencing Work Using the Hill:
  - The hill chart aids in sequencing work by guiding teams to tackle the riskiest or most uncertain parts of the project first
  - Teams prioritize uphill work early in the project, leaving routine or less concerning tasks for later stages
  - A concept called the inverted pyramid has most of the important information at the top and it decreases in order of importance, this can also be used in software projects when assigning tasks
